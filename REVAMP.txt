User Service (ASP.NET):
    Unit Testing: NUnit or MSTest for unit tests in C#.
    Integration Testing: ASP.NET Core Test Host for integration tests.
    End-to-End Testing: Selenium WebDriver or Cypress for end-to-end testing of the API endpoints.

Calories Calculator (Express/Node.js):
    Unit Testing: Mocha or Jest for unit tests in JavaScript/TypeScript.
    Integration Testing: Supertest for testing Express.js routes and middleware.
    End-to-End Testing: You can use the same tools as for the User Service if there are endpoints to test.

Workout Service (Express/Node.js):
    Unit Testing: Mocha or Jest for unit tests in JavaScript/TypeScript.
    Integration Testing: Supertest for testing Express.js routes and middleware.
    End-to-End Testing: Same as above if applicable.

Frontend (Angular or React):
    Unit Testing: Jasmine or Jest for testing Angular components or React components respectively.
    Integration Testing: Angular TestBed or React Testing Library for testing component interactions.
    End-to-End Testing: For Angular, you can use Protractor. For React, tools like Cypress or Selenium WebDriver can be used.



---------
API Automation Testing:
    Postman: Postman is a popular tool for API testing that allows you to automate tests, create collections, and run tests in different environments.
    RestAssured: If you're using Java, RestAssured is a powerful library for automating REST API tests.

UI Automation Testing:
    Selenium WebDriver: Selenium WebDriver is widely used for automating browser interactions. You can use it with various programming languages such as Java, Python, C#, etc.
    Cypress: Cypress is a modern JavaScript-based testing framework specifically designed for web applications. It provides an easy-to-use API for automating UI tests and has built-in support for modern web technologies.
    Puppeteer: Puppeteer is a Node.js library developed by Google for controlling Chrome and Chromium browsers. It's particularly useful for automating tasks like form submission, UI interactions, and web scraping.

End-to-End Testing:
    Cypress: Cypress can be used for both UI automation testing and end-to-end testing. It's well-suited for testing the entire application flow from the frontend to the backend.
    TestCafe: TestCafe is another option for end-to-end testing that doesn't require WebDriver or other browser plugins. It runs tests directly in the browser, making it more resilient to changes in the application.

Cross-Browser Testing:
    Sauce Labs or BrowserStack: These are cloud-based platforms that allow you to run automated tests on a wide range of browsers and devices, ensuring compatibility across different environments.

Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD):
    Jenkins, Travis CI, CircleCI: These CI/CD tools can be integrated with your test automation frameworks to automatically run tests whenever new code is pushed to the repository, ensuring that changes don't introduce regressions.
